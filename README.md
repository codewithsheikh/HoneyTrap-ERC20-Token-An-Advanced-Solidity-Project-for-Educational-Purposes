**HoneyTrap ERC20 Token: An Advanced Solidity Project for Educational Purposes**

**Description**
Explore the intricacies of blockchain development with HoneyTrap, an ERC20 smart contract designed to showcase advanced Solidity techniques. This project goes beyond the basics, offering a hands-on example of how to implement custom token features such as transfer restrictions, address blacklisting, and a honeypot mechanism. It's an ideal resource for developers looking to deepen their understanding of smart contract security and customization.

**Why HoneyTrap Stands Out**
**Advanced Solidity Techniques:**
HoneyTrap demonstrates how to extend the standard ERC20 token by incorporating unique features like custom transfer logic and security measures. This provides a real-world example of how to create more robust smart contracts.
**Interactive Learning: **
This project is designed to help developers understand the intricacies of Solidity through practical application. Each feature is implemented with educational intent, making complex concepts easier to grasp.
**Security-Focused Features:**
Learn how to implement critical security measures within a smart contract. HoneyTrap includes a blacklist function and a honeypot mechanism, offering insights into how these features can be used to protect tokens.
Ideal for Developers and Educators: Whether you're enhancing your development skills or teaching others about Solidity, HoneyTrap provides a detailed, real-world example of advanced smart contract design.


**Important Note**
HoneyTrap is designed solely for educational purposes and is not intended for production use. While it showcases advanced Solidity techniques, it requires further development and thorough security auditing before being used in a live environment.
